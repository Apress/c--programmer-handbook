Reader,

You should be able to copy the entire cs file for each sample into your Visual Studio Project and build.  In chapter 10 - 24 you may need to add a reference as well to the appropriate assembly.  You can determine if you need to add a reference by looking at the using statements at the beginning of each cs file.

Thanks
